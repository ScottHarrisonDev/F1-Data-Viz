        <h1>Formula 1 Data Visualization Project</h1>
        <p>
            Formula 1 has come a long way over the last 60 years, in this project I have set out to analyse how the sport
            has changed over the decades and provide some insight into why the sport has been so successful. This analysis
            has been built around data from <a href="https://kaggle.com">Kaggle.com</a> which includes Formula 1 data 
            from 1950 to 2017.
